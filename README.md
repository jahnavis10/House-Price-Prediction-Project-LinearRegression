# House-Price-Prediction-Project-LinearRegression
## üîç Project Summary

This Jupyter Notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on a house pricing dataset. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis to uncover relationships between property features and sale price. The analysis prepares the data for future machine learning applications.

**Key Tools Used:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Exploratory Visualizations
- Feature Correlation Analysis

**Outcome:** Identified key drivers of house prices such as `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `GarageCars`. The dataset is now EDA-ready for future modeling or business decision-making.
